## Group Members and Respective Roles

### Justin Eugene
1) Provided the data for all workouts: Compiled and organized comprehensive workout data, including exercise descriptions, required tools, and difficulty levels for various workout categories. This data was structured for easy integration with the
database to ensure accurate retrieval and user-specific recommendations.
2) Developed the WorkoutPlanBuilder class: Designed and implemented the algorithm within the WorkoutPlanBuilder class to generate personalized workout plans for each user dynamically. The class considers user preferences, fitness levels, goals, and available equipment to curate effective, well-balanced workout routines.
